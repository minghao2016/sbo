\usage{
get_kgram_freqs(text, dict, n)
}
\arguments{
\item{text}{a character vector. The training corpus from which to extract
k-gram frequencies.}

\item{dict}{a character vector. The language model fixed dictionary (see
details), sorted by word frequency.}

\item{n}{a length one integer. The maximum order of \eqn{latex}{k}-grams
for which frequencies are sought.}
}
\value{
A \code{kgram_freqs} object, containing the \eqn{latex}{k}-gram
frequency tables for \eqn{latex}{k = 1, 2, ..., n}.
}
\description{
Get \eqn{latex}{k}-gram frequency tables from a training corpus.
}
\details{
This function extracts all k-gram frequency tables from a text
corpus up to a specified \eqn{latex}{k}-gram order \eqn{latex}{n}. These are
the building blocks to train any \eqn{latex}{n}-gram model.

\code{get_kgram_freqs} employs a fixed (user specified) dictionary; any
out-of-vocabulary word gets effectively replaced by an "unknown word" token.

The return value is a "\code{kgram_freqs}" object, i.e. a list containing:
\itemize{
\item The highest order of \eqn{latex}{k}-grams, \eqn{latex}{n}.
\item The reference dictionary, sorted by word frequency. This can be obtained
using \code{\link[sbo]{get_word_freqs}}.
\item A list of n tibbles, storing frequency counts for each
\eqn{latex}{k}-gram observed in the training corpus, for
\eqn{latex}{k = 1, 2, ..., n}. In these tibbles, words are represented by
integer numbers corresponding to their position in the
reference dictionary. The special codes \code{0},
\code{length(dictionary)+1} and \code{length(dictionary)+2}
correspond to the "Begin-Of-Sentence", "End-Of-Sentence"
and "Unknown word" tokens, respectively.
